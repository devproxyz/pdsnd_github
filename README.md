### Explore US Bikeshare Data
Udacity Programing for Data Science with Python - Project 2

### Description
This project aims to explore bike share data for three major cities in the United States: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. Using Python, we analyze and visualize various aspects of bike share usage, such as popular routes, user common time analyzing, and trends over time.
By leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, general third party, we provide insights into the dynamics of bike sharing in these urban environments. Whether you're a data enthusiast, urban planner, or simply curious about bike share systems, this project offers a comprehensive exploration of bike share data for these cities.

### Files used
- bikeshare.py: The code for analyzing Bikeshare data for US cities
- chicago.csv: The bikeshare data of Chicago city
- new_york_city.csv: The bikeshare data of New York city
- washington.csv: The bikeshare data of Washington city

## Softwares used
- Visual Studio Code editor
- Terminal application

## Datasets
In this project, the data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
